while start working on project we first create files in a src folder.
Now we create a .prettier file let understand the use of this file --> it enforces a consistence style by parsing our code and reprinting it with its own rules .

# Dev-dependencies --> when we install packages for developemnt some of the packages are not used in production so we called them dev-dependencies.

why we need to download dotenv --> it loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env


now let us discuss about the process.exit() method --> it is used to forcefully terminate nodeJs process.
process.exit()--> indicates successful termination
process.exit()--> indicates an error or abnormal termination
other non-zero number are used to represent different meaning or error conditions.

"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules src/index.js"
}
why we define script like this ?
-r dotenv/config  this part tell nodeJs to require dotenv package and load environment variable form .env file using dotenv/config module.
The --experimental-json-modules flag specifically enables loading JSON files as ES modules. Basically enable to use import and export in nodejs.
src/index.js --> this is entry point of our nodeJs application for which nodemon watch them.
